GpsPrune is a program that helps you to work with your GPS data after you finish a trip. You can use it to open, view, and edit your GPS data in different formats like tab-separated or comma-separated files, XML, or directly from a GPS receiver. It also allows you to display the data on a map or altitude profile, delete certain points, sort waypoints, and save the data in various formats. You can also export the data to Google Earth, to a GPS receiver, or even calculate distances, altitudes, and more. It's a great tool to clean up and organize your GPS data.
