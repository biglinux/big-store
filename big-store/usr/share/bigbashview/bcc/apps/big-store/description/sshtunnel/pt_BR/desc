sshtunnel is a pure python implementation of the SSH protocol on both the client and server side. It allows you to create secure tunnels between computers, just like the SSH command line tool, but with the added flexibility of being able to run it in your own program. This can be useful for automating tasks, or for creating a secure connection to a remote server. The CLI version of sshtunnel is easy to use, and can be used to create both local and remote port forwarding tunnels. It supports both password and key-based authentication, as well as proxy command execution. This makes  it a powerful tool for both system administrators and developers.
