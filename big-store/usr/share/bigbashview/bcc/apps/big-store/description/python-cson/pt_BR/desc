 python-cson is a Python module that allows you to parse and convert CSON files into Python dictionaries. CSON is a format similar to JSON, but with a more relaxed syntax that allows for additional features like comments and unquoted keys. This module makes it easy to work with CSON files in your Python projects, allowing you to read and write data in a format that is both human-readable and easy for computers to process.
